### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

  Lab 3, part 2  was my favorite because as an American who never learned the metric system. This makes it difficult to understand certain thing about the rest of the world. I was able to write functions for the first time
  that calculate the conversion from milliliter to teaspoons. This allowed me to then convert to larger units like a cup or oz's.


  

* Lab 6
  
  Lab 6, part 2 was my second favorite because it was a fun game that i was
  able to play with my family. In this Lab we wrote a function that basically
  checked to if the input matched the secret number(secret number was also an input).


* Lab 10

  Lab 10, part 1 was my third favorite because I have a deep hatred of finding the area of almost any shape. In Lab we wrote a function that
  used the formula to find the area of a rectangle. This really put into 
  context just how easy it is to automate simply task.
